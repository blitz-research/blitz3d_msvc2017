## Blitz3D open source release.

You will need to install Microsoft Visual Studio. Any recent version should be OK, tested with community editions 2019 and 2022 .

When selecting components to install, select "Desktop development with C++", "MFC and ATL support" and "ASP.NET and web development".

### To build with cmake

* Do something like this in the root blitz3d source directory:

``` bash
mkdir cmake-build
cd cmake-build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A Win32 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelMinSize ..
cmake --build .
```

* Build results should appear in the _release directory - look for Blitz3D.exe there and run it!
 

### To build with Visual Studio

* Open blitz3d.sln in Visual Studio.

* Select release config and rebuild the entire solution.

* Build results should appear in the _release directory - look for Blitz3D.exe there and run it!
 
* You can also try building the debug version, although this hasn't been well tested.


### Too lazy to build?

* Grab the prebuilt version from https://blitzresearch.itch.io/


### FMOD dll required!

* This version of blitz3D uses the dynamic version of the fmod audio lib. When redistributing executables built with Blitz3D you will need to include the fmod.dll file found in the _runtime/bin directory with your programs. This should be placed in the same directory as your program's executable.
